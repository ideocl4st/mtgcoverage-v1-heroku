"New" MTGCoverage
=================

This is the source code of a website that keeps track of Magic the Gathering tournament VODs with some extra information.

It is an almost exact carbon copy of [MTGCoverage](http://mtgcoverage.com) that was built with the source code provided by the original author.

Main changes are:

1. Removed v2 related things. (These will be kept intact in [here](https://github.com/ideocl4st/MTGCoverage-Original))

2. Changed database credentials to match that of heroku accounts with ClearDB.

3. Removed stream updating capability. (It needed me to setup heroku scheduler, and I didn't see this to be a necessity)

4. Update deprecated functions no longer used by PHP.
