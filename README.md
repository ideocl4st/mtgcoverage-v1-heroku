"New" MTGCoverage
=================

This is an almost exact carbon copy of http://mtgcoverage.com v1.


Main changes are:

1. Removed v2 related things (These will be kept intact in https://github.com/ideocl4st/MTGCoverage-Original)

2. Changed database credentials to match that of heroku accounts with ClearDB.

3. Removed stream updating capability (It needed me to setup heroku scheduler, and I didn't see this to be a necessity)

4. Update deprecated functions no longer used by PHP

I am not too sure about licensing, as most of the code and database was not mine to begin with.
However, what I am sure is that if you are going to use any part of this program and/or database, please acknowledge the original author (https://twitter.com/mtgcoverage) and wish him the best for his next endeavors.
